# Expo Navigation App

This is a React Native project using Expo to demonstrate navigation between different screens. The app includes examples of stack navigation, tab navigation, and drawer navigation.

## Recomendations before install 

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: We recommend using the latest LTS version.
- **Bun**: A fast JavaScript runtime. You can install it from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).
- **Expo CLI**: Install it globally using npm, yarn, or bun:
   ```sh
   bun add -g expo-cli
   ```
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) or **Xcode** (for iOS development).

Alternatively, you can use **pnpm** as a package manager instead of bun:
- Install pnpm globally:
   ```sh
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```
- Use pnpm to install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
- Start the project with pnpm:
   ```sh
   pnpm run android
   ```
